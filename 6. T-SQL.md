### Task
You have a database with two tables: `Orders` and `Customers`. The `Orders` table has the following structure:

- `order_id` (INT, Primary Key)
- `customer_id` (INT, Foreign Key)
- `order_date` (DATE)
- `order_amount` (DECIMAL(10, 2))

The `Customers` table has the following structure:

- `customer_id` (INT, Primary Key)
- `customer_name` (NVARCHAR(255))
- `registration_date` (DATE)

Write a SQL query in SQL Server that retrieves the top 5 customers who have spent the most on orders, including their total spend amount. The result should include the customerâ€™s name and the total spend amount. Ensure that your query is optimized for performance, especially considering a large dataset.
