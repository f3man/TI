# Multithreading Task 1
Implement a program that simulates a train station using a `X` object to control access to the platform. The program should allow multiple trains to arrive and depart the station, but only one train should be on the platform at a time. The `X` object should be used to synchronize access to the platform, and the program should ensure that trains are serviced in the order they arrive at the station

# Multithreading Task 2
Implement a program that simulates a restaurant ordering system using `Y`. The program should allow multiple customers to place orders simultaneously, but the kitchen should only process a configurable maximum number of orders at once. The `Y` object should be used to limit the number of orders that can be processed concurrently, and the program should ensure that orders are processed in the order they were received. Additionally, the program should implement a timeout mechanism to prevent customers from waiting indefinitely for their orders, and should use the `Y` object to enforce the timeout.
